In particular, in the idea that a first step in understanding our impact is that we must understand the nature of our partnerships. While the work that is being shared is focused on a survey that is applicable to our full model school partners, the same principles apply to our work with districts and other partners. We must understand the system that produces the current outcomes, and we must measure that system in order to improve it."

If someone reaches out to the research team to ask about impact in a partner for, say, a board meeting, we take a few steps to try to find out where we are and what services we are providing. Typically, this starts with salesforce, which often does not meet our needs because it does not actually let us know what is happening with a partner. Sometimes, we will do a google drive search and find something, but we aren’t sure of it’s accuracy. Inevitably, we reach out to a managing director, who reaches out to a district or regional director, who reaches out to the coach or associate serving that district. They go back up the ladder, and we get the best answer we can.\nNow, imagine this for the annual report… we need to find places to disrupt this process, and I hope that we can use the presentation today as a case study for all that can be learned when we do."

Being able to see the interplay between these products in our full school model schools is one place where we can start to see the system.\nI also note here that the questions were filled out by a coach, and so are not a direct measure of school interest or implementation. However, they are a good proxy for understanding the system."

If this data is important, we should come up with a way to systematically collect all of it."

We asked coaches to not only tell us if they were implementing, but also to tell us if they were implementing with modifications that undercut the intent of the curriculum, or if they were implementing with modifications that were within the integrity of the curriculum. This is another way we can understand the system that produces the current outcomes."
