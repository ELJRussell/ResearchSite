This school is modifying a 6th-grade module and teaching it to 7th-graders. This school is also mixing units to save time.\",\"For ALL Block, the school has 4 stations instead of 5; some stations overlap with different skills. Teachers are expected to go through 2 rotations in one period with a minimum of 2 stations. Teachers consistently use at least one part of ALL block materials when planning each week.\",\"for ALL BLOCK they are creating their own student stations instead of using the ideas given in the curriculum\",\"For ALL BLOCK teachers are substituting test prep materials for some of the stations.\",\"In a recent visit teachers mentioned skipping Unit 3 to meet the district pacing expectations. I'm not sure how many teachers did that this year with M2.\",\"Grade 3 M2 is being modified by adding more questions that align with state test questions. Some assessments are modified especially for grade 5, this could look like not teaching Unit 3 or adjusting the assessments to resemble past state tests.\",\"7th grade may have switched the text, 8th grade switched the order of modules.\",\"Gradual rollout of all block. they have to condense ALL Block and MOdule lessons to fit into roughly 90 mins\",\"They've created their own pacing calendars, they've added in field trips or community connections.\",\"They are connecting the modules and performance tasks to their communities.\",\"They are implementing the module lessons but are cutting things out that undercut the integrity of the curriculum. We are working on building their knowledge of the \\\"why\\\" behind the structure of the curriculum and how it aligns with NYC reads so that they are more invested.\",\"I understand the modifications to be mainly around supporting student needs in grades 3-5. Grades K-2 could use more support around sticking to the integrity of the modules.\",\"Grades 2, 3 and 5 have added writing LTs to each lesson because teachers want it to reflect more of a writing workshop approach, and this affects pacing as well as integrity of teaching  the selected skills per module. Skills block has not been focusing on all rotations needed; some teachers are doing the whole group lesson.\",\"The school has added a 7-day writing unit after each Unit 1 of each module to address the perception of not enough or not rigorous enough writing instruction. One grade 3 class also modifies all the lesson activities and formats often without regard to integrity of the lesson.\",\"Grade 8 teaches until mastery of standards, so we won't see rule of 3 or student-led learning in quite the same way since a lot of it is teaching to the whole class. This has also affected pacing in Grade 6.\",\"They refer to their phonics instruction as Skills Block. The only Skills Block resource they are open to using is the EL Skills Scope and Sequence.\",\"They merge our curricculum with existing cross-curricular themes and projects in each unit\",\"Teachers are removing large chunks of modules in 8th grade.\",\"I believe with Skills and ALL Block bits and pieces of both programs are being used, so being able to uphold the integrity of both and reinforce module content gets lost, in some classrooms that I have seen but not all.\",\"The modifications Ive described are mostly due to the school not having or giving the requisite instructional time for the curriculum\",\"LT is interested in RTTW and Core Practices. Not enough devices for Unlock Phonics to occur for all students who tested in, LT is not clear on what Unlock Phonics is or who it is for and it has been difficult to connect with the LT to talk about Unlock Phonics. LT directs teachers to use only one Learning Target from the daily Module Lesson. LT tells teachers they must have an I do, we do and you do part in the module lessons. The existing scheduling and instructional mindsets and asks, interrupt the flow of the Module Lessons and change the structure and then the students receive disjointed instruction that lessons impact.
